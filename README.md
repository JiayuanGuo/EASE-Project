# EASE-Project_v1.0
===============
Electricity Analysis Suggestion Ensemble, or short for EASE, is a Proejct guided by the eScience Insititue and Chemical Engineering Department at the University of Washington. 

EASE is classification model that predicts best electricity generation source from weather, cost, carbon dioxide emission/taxation, and energy source distribution data at a specific user input location within the states. The output of the model is an optimized suggestion with most economical, best weather suitable, clean, and most efficient. EASE project  utilized Machine Learning (RamdomForest) algorithem from scikit-learn to do classificiation.
