# EASE Project
EASE was inspired by the overall consumption distribution map of electricity usage in 2015, shown below. This map shows electricity generation source by location and amount in the states. Among many of the electricity generation source, the conventional generation source dominated the market, such that these generation accompanied with high CO2 emission as well as heavy taxations.

The goal of EASE is to develop a predicative model using ML to provide users suggestions on the best electricity generation source type.
